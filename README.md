# vigilant-tribble
There's only one way to figure out how this [new-fangled "every repo can be a website thing"](https://github.com/blog/2289-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3) works.

I find it delightful that GitHub suggested the name **vigilant-tribble** to me! YES THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
